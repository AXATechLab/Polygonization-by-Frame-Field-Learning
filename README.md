Given an overhead image, the model outputs an edge mask, an interior mask,
and a frame field for buildings. The total loss includes terms that align the masks and
frame field to ground truth data as well as regularizers to enforce smoothness of the
frame field and consistency between the outputs.

Overview of our post-processing polygonization algorithm. Given an interior
classification map and frame field as input, we optimize the contour to
align to the frame field using an Active Skeleton Model (ASM) and detect corners using
the frame field, simplifying non-corner vertices.

# Introduction

We add a frame field output to an image segmentation neural network to improve segmentation quality 
and provide structural information for a subsequent polygonization step. 
A frame field encodes two directions up to sign at every point of an image. 
To improve segmentation, we train a network to align an output frame field to the tangents of ground truth contours. 
In addition to increasing performance by leveraging the multi-task learning effect, 
our method produces more regular segmentations and is more robust due to the additional learning signal.

# Setup

## Git submodules

This project uses various git submodules that should be cloned too.

To clone a repository including its submodules execute:
```
git clone --recursive --jobs 8 <URL to Git repo>
```

If you already have cloned the repository and now want to load itâ€™s submodules execute:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs 8
```
or:
```
git submodule update --recursive
```

For more about explanations about using submodules and git, see [SUBMODULES.md](SUBMODULES.md).

## Docker

The easiest way to setup environment is to use the Docker image provided in the [docker](docker) (see README inside the folder).

Once the docker container is built and launched, execute the [setup.sh](setup.sh) script inside to install required packages.

The environment in the container is now ready for use.

# Data

Several datasets are used in this work. 
We typically put all datasets in a "data" folder which we link to the "/data" folder in the container (with the ```-v``` argument when running the container).
Each dataset has it's own sub-folder, usually named with a short version of that dataset's name. 
Each dataset sub-folder should have a "raw" folder inside containing all the original folders and files fo the datset.
When pre-processing data, "processed" folders will be created alongside the "raw" folder.

For example, the CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset should have the following file structure inside the container:

```
/data 
`-- mapping_challenge_dataset
     |-- raw
         |-- train
         |   |-- images
         |   |-- annotation.json
         |   `-- annotation-small.json
         `-- val
              `-- ...
```

If however you would like to use a different folder for the datasets (for example while not using Docker), 
you can change the path to datasets in config files.
You can modify the "data_dir_candidates" list in the config to only include your path. 
The training script checks this list of paths one at a time and picks the first one that exists. 
It then appends the "data_root_partial_dirpath" directory to get to the dataset.

# Running the main.py script

Execute [main.py](main.py) script to train a model, test a model or use a model on your own image.
See the help of the main script with:

```python main.py --help```

The script can be launched on multiple GPUs for multi-GPU training and evaluation.
Simply set the ```--gpus``` argument to the number of gpus you want to use. 
However, for the first launch of the script on a particular dataset (when it will pre-process the data), 
it is best to leave it at 1 as I did not implement multi-GPU synchronization when pre-processing datasets.

# Launch inference on one image

Make sure the run folder has the correct structure:

```
Polygonization-by-Frame-Field-Learning
|-- frame-field-learning
|   |-- runs
|   |   |-- <run_name> | yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
|   |   `-- ...
|   |-- inference.py
|   `-- ...
|-- main.py
|-- README.md (this file)
`-- ...
```

Execute the [main.py] script like so (filling values for arguments run_name and in_filepath):
```python main.py --run_name <run_name> --in_filepath <your_image_filepath>```

The outputs will be saved next to the input image
